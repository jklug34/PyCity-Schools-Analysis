# PyCity-Schools-Analysis
An analysis of district-wide standardized test results uncovering the factors that increase school performance


* Schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending per student actually ($615-645/student : 80% passing rate; $645-675/student : 73% passing rate) underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (<$585/student : 95% passing rate; $585-615 : 95% passing rate).

* Smaller (<1000) and medium sized schools (1000-2000) dramatically out-performed large sized schools(2000-5000) on average math and reading performances (94-95% passing vs 76%).

* Charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics (Charter overall passing rate 95% vs. District overall passing rate 74%) However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school. 

* There were not significant gains in performance from 9th Grade to 12th Grade within a given school.
